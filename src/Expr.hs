Expressions are built up from terminal expressions using brackets, braces, commas, alternating, logical terms etc. Terminal expressions are defined outside. As an example, terminal expressions are logical symbols, program variables, function's calls, pointers, referenses.

There are two classes of expressions: logical and program. Logical expressions represent logical terms that are elements of inner language of the system. Program expressions represent program terms that are elements of outer language of the system. The type @Expr@ is used for denoting common parts of logical and program expressions.
